# API_Development_Flask
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my understanding of REST APIs. This is a local web app with the Flask framework that returns a JSON object, containing a timestamp, page type and a list of 10 integers.

While this is a simple example of a local API server, this can be deployed through Heroku, Google App Engine, AWS Lambda, or other web hosting service providers.
